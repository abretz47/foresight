# Foresight (pre-release)
A mobile app for logging golf range data so players can track and visualize their target effiencies throughout their bag.

This app is pre-release software and should _NOT_ be considered a working product. However, for those interested, here is a [functional prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/GhdtgXZuIEhTQI3X5p8MfP/Foresight?node-id=0) for the expected experience of how a user would enter their range data. 

For those browsing to understand the technical approach, this is a React.js frontend app, utilizing a Firebase Firestore database and Facebook Authentication.
